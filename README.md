# Micro-II-Lab-1
This lab was demonstrated by: Danny Webb-McClain, Youssef Chahine, and Michael Kradjian.
The Goal of this lab is to demonstrate a traffic system for traffic moving in a one way direction. The circuit starts
in a stagnant state with Red LED blinking until the button is pressed to commence the start of the circuit. Once the 
circuit has started the traffic system will work its way through all states of the traffic light, and will sound a buzzer
briefly before changing states.
